An app to assess emergency department overcrowding via the NEDOCS score.
NEDOCS Score App

This project introduces an app designed to assess emergency department (ED) overcrowding using the National Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale (NEDOCS) score.

Problem: Emergency Department Overcrowding

ED overcrowding is a critical issue impacting patient care and outcomes. This app leverages the NEDOCS score to quantify the level of overcrowding, enabling proactive measures.

Solution: Addressing Overcrowding with NEDOCS

The app utilizes advanced algorithms for real-time NEDOCS score calculation. The score considers factors like patient volume, arrival rate, acuity level, and available resources.

Benefits:

Real-time insights: Inform decision-making for efficient ED management.
Improved resource allocation: Optimize resource utilization based on real-time data.
Enhanced patient flow: Reduce wait times and improve patient experience.
Data-driven approach: Gain valuable insights through performance analytics.
Key Features:

User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
Real-time data collection for immediate decision support.
Performance analytics to identify trends and patterns.
Project Status

This is an introductory overview of the NEDOCS Score App. Further development will involve:

Implementing core functionalities for NEDOCS score calculation and data collection.
Developing a user interface for data input and visualization.
Integrating with existing hospital systems for data exchange.
